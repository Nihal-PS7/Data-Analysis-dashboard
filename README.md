2. **Data Cleaning and Validation (Excel):**
   - Cleaned the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting any inconsistencies.
   - Validated the data to ensure accuracy for analysis.

3. **Data Analysis (SQL):**

   - Ran queries to filter and aggregate data based on specific criteria (e.g., region, time period).

4. **Data Visualization (Power BI):**
   - Created a **Power BI** dashboard to visualize the sales data and KPIs.
   - Developed charts, graphs, and tables to display insights like sales trends, top-performing products, and regional performance.

5. **Reporting and Insights:**
   - Provided actionable insights from the dashboard to stakeholders.
